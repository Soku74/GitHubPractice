<article>
    Starting in 1945 our founder John D Smith Started The Sprout Grow business, In Durham North Carolina, at the age of 65 years. Coming from a moderately wealthy family where education was taken very seriously. John in his younger years loved learning about plants especially red roses and watermelons which were his favorite, wanted to start his own business selling high-quality organic plants to the public. John's father Mr. Smith sold Tabasco hot sauce and owned a couple factories producing the Infamous sauce. John adored his father's work ethic and aspired to run a company just like him. Laying out the ground work for his company John D Smith Instilled within himself and his employees a commitment to Excellence, organic practices, and environmental sustainability as Well as educating the youth to the process of growing and taking care of plants of all kinds. John always had a saying, <b>“This company should convey a sense of trust, expertise and Innovation within the field of organic gardening for today and generations to come.- John D Smith”. </b>

    Sadly after the founders passing in 1952 the company has been passed down from generation to generation leading us to todays new founder and location Rockefeller D Smith, and has been in charge of the company since 2000-present day and is now 58 years old. We have since relocated to downtown Raleigh 27600 Glenwood ave near the marbles museum. Sticking to the american tradition of hard work and dedication,Sprout and grow has expanded to more than 12 locations across the East Coast of the United States!
